Initially, a very small amount will be airdropped to multiple recipients. Then final airdrops will take place to anyone participating in the prize pools. See below for details.","Eventually there is a possibility of issuing token buybacks from a percentage of the prizes earnt in the pools. It must be noted that this token is more of a tool to promote, facilitate and govern the DeFi Prizes protocol.

You will qualify for this airdrop if you recieve some of the specified deposit tokens.","E.g. We currently have a PNG draw running. At any point in time, the protocol can look up recent transactions on the c-chain to see who has received some PNG (this will most likely be from a DEX).

Your percentage is determined by how many tokens you referred. E.g. A draw is about to be run with 10,000 tokens in the prize pool. Normally, the referral pool is 10% of the prize pool so 1,000 tokens will be in the referral pool. If you referred 2 tokens, and only one other person managed to refer 2 tokens also, you will be allocated 50% of the referral pool.
